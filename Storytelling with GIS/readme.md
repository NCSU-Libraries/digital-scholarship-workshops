##  Storytelling with GIS Maps

### Workshop description:

In this workshop, you will learn how to create a story map using a combination of interactive ArcGIS Online base maps, images and text. Using Esriâ€™s cloud-based story mapping GIS platform, you will learn how to design a web-based map with sample geographic data, text and images. Together, we will take a look at several example story map application templates and build an interactive linear online map that tells your own geographic story.
