##  Tracking Online Research Engagement with Altmetrics and R

### Workshop description:

Altmetrics tracks how often journal articles with a unique identifier (doi, arxiv id, isbn, etc.) are being discussed, shared, downloaded, or saved on social media platforms, news outlets, policy documents, and online reference managers.  Using R, a statistical computing language, this workshop will teach participants how to retrieve and process data from the Altmetrics.com API to visualize and compare online research engagement across multiple scholarly publications. This workshop is geared toward intermediate-level R users, as the basics of R will not be covered. While not required, you may be interested in attending the following related workshops: "Understand and Build Your Scholarly Identity" and "Measuring Your Research Impact."
