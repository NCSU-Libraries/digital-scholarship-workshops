Infographics can be powerful tools for communicating research and achieving greater impact. Yet, while a good infographic clarifies and captivates, a bad infographic distorts and distracts. This workshop will cover basic design and narrative principles for creating infographics that balance visual appeal with data integrity. We will discuss multiple resources for generating infographics. Participants will gain hands-on experience creating an infographic with free infographic creation tools.
