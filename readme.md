This repository contains materials created by the NCSU Libraries for our [Digital Scholarship Workshop Series](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/news/digital-scholarship-workshop-series-debuts-at-the-libraries). The Spring 2018 launch of the series focused on topics such as scholarly identity, research impact metrics, and the digital humanities. The series is still growing, so we will be adding more workshop materials to this repository.  Our workshop series supports an open environment for researchers to learn digital tools and methods for creating, sharing, and evaluating new forms of scholarly outputs. 

These workshop materials are intended as a resource for anyone who wants to conduct or adapt these digital scholarship workshops.
