##  Getting Started with Building Digital Exhibits in Omeka

### Workshop description:

Omeka is an open source web application used by archives, libraries, and museums all over the world to manage and describe digital images, audio files, videos, and texts to create attractive, customizable web exhibits and databases. In this introduction to Omeka, you’ll learn how to set up a free version of Omeka from Omeka.net to create your own digital archive of images and texts that meets scholarly metadata standards and creates a search engine-optimized website. We’ll go over the difference between the hosted version of Omeka and the open source server-side version of Omeka, and how to begin building a digital exhibit.


Note: The workshop instructions are largely based on a document created by Ronda Grizzle (University of Virginia) for an Omeka/Neatline workshop.
