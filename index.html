</h2>
<p>It is increasingly necessary for researchers to have a professional presence online. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to establish and manage your scholarly identity to help you connect with colleagues, find collaborators, and expose your research to new audiences. You’ll also learn how to boost your scholarly impact using social media and alternative metrics that come with these new methods of knowledge communication and online dissemination.</p>

</h2>
<p>Have you ever wanted your own professional website but don’t know where to start? In this workshop, you will create a free website for professional use, with options for blogging, hosting syllabi, resumes or portfolios. You will learn three tools, including Jekyll, a static website generator, Markdown, for updating content, and Github Pages for freely hosting the site. At the end of the workshop, you should have your site up and running, and know how to edit it for future use.</p><p><b><a href="https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/">Instructions</a></b></p>

</h2>
<p>As scholarly outputs continue to evolve and more scientific grant proposals require broader impact statements, it is important to gather evidence of how your research will have a greater impact upon society. This workshop will provide an introduction to broader impacts and how traditional and nontraditional scholarly metrics, such as Journal Impact Factor, h-index, Eigenfactor Score, and Altmetrics, are being used to measure research impact.</p>

</h2>
<p>Altmetrics tracks how often journal articles with a unique identifier (doi, arxiv id, isbn, etc.) are being discussed, shared, downloaded, or saved on social media platforms, news outlets, policy documents, and online reference managers.  Using R, a statistical computing language, this workshop will teach participants how to retrieve and process data from the Altmetrics.com API to visualize and compare online research engagement across multiple scholarly publications. This workshop is geared toward intermediate-level R users, as the basics of R will not be covered. While not required, you may be interested in attending the following related workshops: "Understand and Build Your Scholarly Identity" and "Measuring Your Research Impact."</p>

</h2>
<p>In this workshop, you will learn how to create a story map using a combination of interactive ArcGIS Online base maps, images and text. Using Esri’s cloud-based story mapping GIS platform, you will learn how to design a web-based map with sample geographic data, text and images. Together, we will take a look at several example story map application templates and build an interactive linear online map that tells your own geographic story.</p>

</h2>
<p>This introductory workshop on text encoding in XML will teach you the structure of XML and the principles of text encoding with the Text Encoding Initiative P5 Guidelines. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines makes it possible to create and publish digital scholarly editions by defining a standard XML vocabulary. In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of structuring a TEI document, how to record bibliographic metadata, and how to start creating transcriptions of manuscripts and other primary sources for digital humanities projects. No prior experience with XML or TEI is expected.</p>

</h2>
<p>Omeka is an open source web application used by archives, libraries, and museums all over the world to manage and describe digital images, audio files, videos, and texts to create attractive, customizable web exhibits and databases. In this introduction to Omeka, you’ll learn how to set up a free version of Omeka from Omeka.net to create your own digital archive of images and texts that meets scholarly metadata standards and creates a search engine-optimized website. We’ll go over the difference between the hosted version of Omeka and the open source server-side version of Omeka, and how to begin building a digital exhibit. Note: The workshop instructions are largely based on a document created by Ronda Grizzle (University of Virginia) for an Omeka/Neatline workshop.</p>

</h2>
<p>Building off of our previous workshop offering, "Getting Started with Building Digital Exhibits in Omeka," this workshop will provide tips and tricks for customizing Omeka’s themes and how to use Omeka plugins for creating relational data, digital collections, maps, timelines, and annotation tools. Participants are encouraged to bring their own ideas for digital research projects and questions about using Omeka. We will use some of the workshop time to offer advice and suggestions on what plugins to use that are specific to participants’ digital research projects. Note: This workshop predominately focuses on Neatline.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to create 360° videos? In this workshop, you will learn how to engage, explore, and tell stories with immersive imagery using 360° videos. This introductory workshop will teach you how to storyboard videos, operate a Ricoh Theta 360° camera, and go over the workflow of planning, capturing, and editing 360° video, adding 360° metadata to published videos, and how to upload the video to YouTube for 360° viewing.</p>

</h2>
<p>Infographics can be powerful tools for communicating research and achieving greater impact. Yet, while a good infographic clarifies and captivates, a bad infographic distorts and distracts. This workshop will cover basic design and narrative principles for creating infographics that balance visual appeal with data integrity. We will discuss multiple resources for generating infographics. Participants will gain hands-on experience creating an infographic with free infographic creation tools.</p>
