##  Advanced Omeka

### Workshop description:

Building off of our previous workshop offering, “Getting Started with Building Digital Exhibits in Omeka,” this workshop will provide tips and tricks for customizing Omeka’s themes and how to use Omeka plugins for creating relational data, digital collections, maps, timelines, and annotation tools. Participants are encouraged to bring their own ideas for digital research projects and questions about using Omeka. We will use some of the workshop time to offer advice and suggestions on what plugins to use that are specific to participants’ digital research projects.


Note: This workshop predominately focuses on Neatline.
