## Harvesting Data from Twitter Workshop
### 

Workshop Description:

This is an informal learning session (rather than a formal workshop) where we will learn how to harvest Twitter data using R. You'll learn the basics of working with R and should have a file of tweets to explore by the end of the workshop. There will be quite a bit of time after the learning portion for experimentation.
